**Basic Knowledge Quiz Portal**

The goal of the website is to test the user's understanding of basic facts related to our world. It has several user-friendly quizzes dedicated to different topics. Each quiz will assign a score for the knowledge in this particular area. After all quizzes are completed, the overall score is displayed, and the pass is granted if the minimum score is reached.
